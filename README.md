## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop an efficient model for the recognition of top quarks from complex particle event data. The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle and plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. Accurate identification of top quarks can provide valuable insights into high-energy particle interactions and fundamental physics.

## Data
The dataset used in this project consists of simulated particle events, each described by a series of features representing various physical quantities.

## LSTM for Classification
We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to classify particle events. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making them an ideal choice for handling the sequential nature of particle event data.

## Genetic Algorithm for Hyperparameter Optimization
To enhance the performance of the LSTM model, we utilize a genetic algorithm to optimize its hyperparameters. Genetic algorithms are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection, and they are particularly effective in exploring large and complex search spaces.

## Results
Our optimized LSTM model demonstrates high accuracy in recognizing top quarks from particle events. Detailed results and performance metrics are provided in the accompanying report.
